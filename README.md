# Summary
This is a simple app to provide a list of providers that have vaccine available in the central IA area.

## Why
Finding where vaccines are available and scheduling appointments is stupidly hard in IA at the moment.
This provides much closer to real time updates on vaccine availability since IA
is unwilling, or unable, to do so.
